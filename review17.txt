Get there early on Sunday's if you need service from the Genius Bar and you'll be fine. I got there at 10am and waited one hour to ensure that I was in and out quickly. I was second in line when I arrived and I was helped right at 11am.
Anthony was the Genius Bar associate that helped me and he was very helpful and friendly.

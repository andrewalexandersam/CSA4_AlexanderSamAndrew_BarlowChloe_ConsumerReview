Ordering and scheduling iPhone pickup through the Apple Store app was quick and easy--great online experience.

However, the in-store experience didn't live up to Apple's usual standards. When I arrived for my appointment, I expected at least a basic level of acknowledgment or guidance.

Instead, several employees were standing around, visibly bored, and no one greeted me or offered assistance. I had to go out of my way to flag someone down to complete the pickup, which felt a bit awkward considering I was there to pick up a brand-new device.

For a company known for great products, the lack of acknowledgment and customer service was surprising.

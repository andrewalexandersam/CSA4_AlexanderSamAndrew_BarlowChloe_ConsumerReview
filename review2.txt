Stopped in to pick up my Apple Watch, and honestly, the experience was... fine.

The customer service wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either -- just kind of indifferent, like they're running on autopilot. Nobody went out of their way, nobody really cared, and it felt more like a transaction than an experience.

The upside? I was in and out quickly, which is all you really want sometimes. Apple doesn't have to do much these days beyond stocking the shelves -- the products sell themselves. Still, for a company that prides itself on sleek experiences, this one was nothing to write home about.

The Apple Boca Raton is expensive and the service that we get is meh at best.

Quick, efficient, but lacking any personal touch. You'll get what you came for, but don't expect magic -- just merchandise.

Stellar 10 star experience with Cameron today. I am an independent business owner and was without my MacBook Pro for 3 days. May not seem like a lot but this is my primary way to do business and pretty much everything, so downtime really sucks. I was stuck on Activation Lock loop so I couldn't boot into the machine, forgot my iCloud password, couldn't reset it and also couldn't find proof of purchase. I had already been to an Apple servicer (not Genius Bar) who said I had to wait for the password reset process to complete. Thing is it kept saying "check in tomorrow x PM" and then would extend the wait once that time passed. Cameron helped me exhaust all options to get back into my machine. Was very respectful about touching my computer and phone the whole time and spent an hour with me trying to get my computer unlocked. Verified ownership of the machine with the manager so I still feel like my stuff is secure and got Activation Lock removed. I'm now back to normal and ready to do some important business this week! Apple support is supposed to be the best and Cameron really proved that today. Thank you again!

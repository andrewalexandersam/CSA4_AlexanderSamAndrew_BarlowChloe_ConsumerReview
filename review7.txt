This was my second visit to this store to have my iPad evaluated and purchase a new one at the Apple Stoneridge Mall Store.The 3 employees we dealt with were amazing! Jimmy is very knowledgeable about the apple product and very efficient in getting my iPad charged and ready for a trade-in. Lee/Leigh is the perfect person for the store's check-in/greeter. She has a quick-witted personality and her comment about an "apple minute" had my husband and me laughing out loud! Julie is very impressive and completed our sale. She's also very knowledgeable about the apple product and we couldn't believe she's only been at the store for only 3-4 weeks. Thank you for the great service, job well done.

Dropped my phone off and paid over $400 for the front screen replacement. There are new scratches on my phone when I picked it up 2 hours later. The manager Bel denied that her tech damaged my phone during the repair and tried to question me. Yet the pictures showed these scratches weren't there before the repair. This is second time I came to this store and I had never had good experience. Never again!

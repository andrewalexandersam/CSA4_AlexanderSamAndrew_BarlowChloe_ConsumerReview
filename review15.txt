I was here for the battery issue of my laptop. I reached here much earlier than my appointment and still the moment I entered, I was asked by one of their representatives and after understanding my purpose of visit they immediately referred me to a technician who diagnosed the issue after going through a few checks and gave me options to choose , where one of the option was not to worry about anything except that I can use my power cord. It saved me money and I was really very happy with the service and the suggestions that were shared with me. It was a wonderful experience, thank you.

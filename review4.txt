I was very pleased with the service. The staff is really helpful and educated me on so many things. I'm very pleased . It would be 5 stars but I couldn't find the Apple Store at first. That's a mall problem , not an apple problem. I found that my work discounts made my day so much better since I had to get a computer and an I pad.

They fixed my phone right away and couldn't fix the eating problem , yet gave me great suggestions . I will be back

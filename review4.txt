Went here because my iPhone 13 was not charging. I was approached by a friendly floor employee who sat me down, and I explained the issue to him. He plugged my phone into a charging cord on the table-top and said, "I'll be back in five minutes" and didn't even say it in an Arnold Terminator voice..such a flatliner. I was there for about 20 minutes at which point I saw him come out of the back room in street clothes and leave without looking at me or saying a word. It's funny to me that they go in the back and change after their shift. They are practically wearing street clothes during their shift...

Another floor employee took over and basically told me the solution was to repair the phone. I asked what the process of repairing my phone would be? He told me they remove the camera and screen and put it on another phone and that it would cost $500. But then told me he would sell me another iPhone 13, brand new, for the same price. Such a scam.

These employees are very friendly and polite, however, I feel they are incompetent and unprofessional. They would rather sell you something and make the store money as opposed to find a simple solution for your issue... at least that was the vibe I picked up.

I later took my phone to another repair vendor who was able to get it working again, ultimately saving me over $400.

One star apple store, Hillsdale mall! You earned it.

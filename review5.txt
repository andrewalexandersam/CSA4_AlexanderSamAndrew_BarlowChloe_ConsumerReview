Booking appointments online for the Genius Bar is pretty easy. I recommend them because they don't always take drop-ins if they are busy, which is hard to predict.

I had brought in my 8 year old MacBook that I hadn't touched I years and wouldn't turn on.
Quick checkin process and was walked through the troubleshooting steps (which is so nice cause I can learn from it)
They ended up checking it in to work on since it required a few more hours, and called me once completed same day!
Had there been hardware fixes it would have incurred payment, however their software fixed and tune ups fixed the problem at no cost!
Really appreciate this service from Apple.

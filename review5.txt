I made an appt with the Genius Bar~was having a couple of issues w/my iPhone. Was helped within a minute, I'd say...answered the employees questions, he said it'd be about 8 minutes (great, & I was early)
So, was waiting ~other employees also asked if I was helped...very nice, and I responded that I had and I was just waiting.
An employee said you've been waiting a bit, can I get your name & i'll check up on your status. So, he did check-thankfully-and he stated that I wasn't put into the system!!
Well, thanx to the second guy looking out for me, everything went smoothly & I felt like I was in good hands. (I wish I got the names of those who helped me so graciously).
AND to the employee who didn't put in that I had arrived for my appt!! ( the employee was lite white, thin & balled ..courteous tho)
MINUS TWO STARS BECAUSE I WAS EARLY TO MY APPT, BUT WAS NOT CHECKED IN BY THE FIRST EMPLOYEE

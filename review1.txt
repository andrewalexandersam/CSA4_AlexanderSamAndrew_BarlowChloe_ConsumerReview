My experience at the Pleasant Apple Store was really frustrating. I was told when I entered that I would have to wait half an hour, but I waited for over two hours and no one responded or helped me. When I finally asked about the delay, I was told I would have to wait another 40 minutes. Meanwhile, I watched several customers who arrived after me get assisted and leave.

No clear explanation, no apology, and no order in customer service. It felt chaotic and very unfair. If there was a reason for the delay or some customers had appointments, they should have been informed in advance.

I came to this store expecting Apple level service, efficient, professional, and respectful, but this store did none of that. I ended up leaving without any help and I don't plan to come back. Very disappointed.

The Pleasant Apple Store needs to seriously improve its customer service and management of customer visits and wait times!!!!!!!

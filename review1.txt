Went through the process to make an appointment. Drove 40 minutes to get there checked in early and proceeded to wait for 20 minutes. I watched multiple employees walking around or sitting at a desk doing absolutely nothing. Others were just standing there talking to each other. no one checked in with me. No one ever assisted me. If I could give negative ratings, I would. Seem to be a lot of these types of reviews for this location at Park Meadows Mall.

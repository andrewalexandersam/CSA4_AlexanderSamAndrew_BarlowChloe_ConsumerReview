Came in to get my beats fixed at the Genius Bar. I recommend making an appointment when doing so.
I'm glad I did because this place was packed, even on a Tuesday and from what the staff said, it's always busy. I was able to get my beats sent out with the staff's assistance, since it's under warranty. Love their service. I should receive it within 5 business days at no additional cost.

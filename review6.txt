So all of a sudden, my cell phone signed out of my emails and I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. I tried to get support online and had no luck.

The Apple store is about 10 minutes away from where I live so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was a little bit intimidated because I knew that usually there's a long line or you have to set an appointment and come back in an hour or two.

I happened to luck out today as I walked in and I was greeted by a smiling Suyon. She seemed very confident and eager to help me solve my problem. As I was struggling with my passwords, she remained very patient with me.At one point, she went into the back room to consult with a technician and voil√† I was signed into my emails again on both of my phones and I'm very thankful that I caught Suyon on a day that she works during the week. Thank you, Suyon!

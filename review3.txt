What a contrast for today's visit compared to the previous one. I was there at opening time and the staff was so welcoming, They were even clapping to the customers walking in. I first met with Beau, who was absolutely delightful so helpful and wanted nothing but the best to help me with my technical issue with my new iPhone. He made meeting with the genius bar, so efficient where I met Sam who was an absolute delight and so patient and professional.. kudos to all of you for such a vast improvement in customer service over my previous visits. I will stay loyal to Apple for this reason.

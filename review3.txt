I took my iPad to the Apple Store at Stoneridge Mall and had a very disappointing experience. I was told the screen is "not replaceable" and that my only options were to pay approximately $600 for a replacement unit or purchase a new iPad at full price. No alternative repair path or explanation was provided. For a premium device, this type of response felt dismissive and left me without a reasonable solution.

My family and I have long trusted Apple products because of their stability, performance, and long-term reliability. That is why this situation has been so frustrating. It is difficult to understand why such a premium device cannot be repaired when the issue appears to be a failed component with no physical damage involved.

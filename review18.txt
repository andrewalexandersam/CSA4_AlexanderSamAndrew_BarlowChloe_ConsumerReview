$1,000 phone $2.00 service. iPhone X screen malfunction unable to repair it the same day. I would of made an appointment if one was Available also my phone/computer doesn't allow me to. Apple knows about the problem, Genius Bar rep told me it happened to him. I don't want to get into any particulars but I use my phone for work like most everybody else and waiting to have your phone/computer to get repaired another day is unacceptable. Thanks for nothing Genius Bar.

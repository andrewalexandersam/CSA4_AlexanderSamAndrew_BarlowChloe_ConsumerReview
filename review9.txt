approached an associate for assistance, and while they assured us that help would be sent, we waited for about 20 minutes without any follow-up. During that time, we noticed several associates walking by without offering assistance.

This experience was disappointing, especially since we were interested in purchasing the new watch release. We believe that timely customer service is essential, and we hope you can address this issue to improve the shopping experience for future customers. Off we go to Best Buy!
